 * You must implement the provided interfaces in this project. You should not modify the provided
interfaces. However, you can include additional methods in the implementing classes as
needed.

Your implementation must use the interfaces as types whenever it is possible instead of
using concrete implementing classes as types. You can not use any external libraries in this
project. You can use Java built in data structures.
